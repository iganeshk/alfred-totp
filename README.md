# A-totp

Get totp codes in Alfred in a secure way.

## Installation

`$ brew install oauthtool`

Then insert your totp codes into the macOS keychain `alfred-totp.keychain` like so:

```
$ security -i
> create-keychain alfred-totp.keychain
> set-keychain-settings alfred-totp.keychain
> add-generic-password -a alfred-totp -s "Name of service" -w "TOTP CODE" alfred-totp.keychain
> # repeat above command as needed, crtl-c to quit.
```

Now [download](https://github.com/waynehoover/atotp/releases) and install the worklow.

## Usage

In alfred just type `t` then start typing the name of your service. 

The TOTP code will be pasted to the top most app by default and copied to the clipboard on option return.

## Finding your totp codes
On most websites you can login and see your totp code in the 2-factor setting page.
